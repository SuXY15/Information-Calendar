【个人简历】：
Valentin L. Popov is full professor at the Berlin University of Technology. He studied physics (1976-1982) and obtained his doctorate in 1985 from the Moscow State Lomonosov University. He later worked at the Institute of Strength Physics of the Russian Academy of Sciences. After a guest professorship in the field of theoretical physics at the University of Paderborn (Germany) from 1999 to 2002, he has headed the department of System Dynamics and the Physics of Friction of the Institute of Mechanics at the Berlin University of Technology. His areas of interest include tribology, nanotribology, tribology at low temperatures, biotribology, the influence of friction through ultrasound, numerical simulation of frictional processes, research regarding earthquakes, as well as topics related to materials science such as the mechanics of elastoplastic media with microstructures, strength of metals and alloys, and shape memory alloys. He is the author of the book "Contact Mechanics and Friction: Physical principles and applications" which appeared in three German, two English, Chinese, and Russian editions and co-author of the book on “Method of dimensionality Reduction in Contact Mechanics and Friction” which appeared in German, English and Chinese editions. He is associate editor of international journals and regularly organizes international conferences and workshops about diverse tribological themes. He is a member of the Scientific Council of the German Tribological Society.

【预备知识】：常规的有关力学、数值计算、软件等相关课程知识背景。
【课程简介】：
This course will introduce foundations of the Boundary Element Method(BEM) and its application in contact mechanics. It will be completed by practical programming exercises. For this sake, the participants of the course will have the possibility of using the program code developed at the TU Berlin. This code can be used both during the course and in the further research under conditions of license agreement which has to be signed by participants of the course.
